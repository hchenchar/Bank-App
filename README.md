# Bank-App

Description/Motivation: This project refactors a previous application to build a back end by adding a MongoDB database to the previous project.
Installation Guidelines: Clone this repository to your local machine, then a command line on your computer and run the command cd path-to-project-root (this should be the actual directory where the repository is located on your local machine)
In the same command line, run "npm install" which will install the necessary dependencies. Once all of the dependencies have been installed, run "http-server -c-1" to start a server. Navigate to your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080

Technology used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDb
Features: This refactored application now includes the integration of the MongoDB Database. Looking ahead, I would like to set up a data abstraction layer to ensure the application is not dependent on one database option. I would also like to add in additional authentication features.
